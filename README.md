This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree.

## Project Overview:

In this project, a static webpage is converted to a mobile-ready web application. That includes, converting the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker is also added to cache the data for the website so that any page that has been visited is accessible offline.


## How to run the application

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal. To check the version of Python you have type in your terminal `python -V`.
    - If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 
    - If you have Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
    - If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
3. Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:8000.
